2D gravity simulation using Allegro - https://www.allegro.cc/

Compile with Visual Studio 2022. Nuget should download the Allegro packages automatically.

This was originally written in around 2002, so the code may not be up to the standard I would usually write today. It was updated recently to take advantage of multiple cores. You can see a video of it in action at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mzq0da1dOE
